			<p>
				Alberta Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Rocky Mountain National Park.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was given its name in the 1800s by Abner Sprague and his wife, who were two of the first people to live in the park.
			</p>
			<p>
				The waterfall can be reached by hiking just a half mile along a gentle uphill trail from the Glacier Gorge Trailhead.	
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many beautiful lookouts along the trail. Come check it out!
