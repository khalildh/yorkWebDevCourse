                <b>
                <li> According to a transmission from a satellite not far from Namek, the battle began on December 18th of Age 762 </li>
                <li> On that day a couple of earthlings arrived on Namek, as well as a Saiyan who we believe was once the prince of thier bloodthirsty race</li>      
                <li> When the prince arrived he slaughtered a few of Frieza's soldiers.</li>
                <li> Frieza responded by calling in the Legendary Ginyu Force</li>
                <li> Another Saiyan, who apparently came up from Earth, decided to team up Frieza and they amazingly were able to defeat the Ginyu Force</li>
                <li> Frieza and the earthlings were all looking for the Namekian dragon balls</li>
                <li> Frieza killed many Namekians and almost all of the warriors that got in his way</li>
                <li> The Namekian Dragon was called forth (The Satellite could not record what was wished for)</li>
                <li> After the Prince was killed, the other saiyan fought Frieza and looked like he might have a chance </li>
                <li> A blinding Golden Flash happened and the rest of our communications are lost</li>
                <li> We find out later the planet has exploded</li>
                <li> End Transmission.</li>
