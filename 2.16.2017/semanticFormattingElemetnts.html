    <p>8 out of 46 words in this poem are the same word:</p>
    <p>This is the man all tattered and torn,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> kissed the maiden all forlorn,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> milked the cow with the crumpled horn,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> tossed the dog,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> worried the cat,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> killed the rat,<br>
    <mark>That</mark> ate the malt<br>
    <mark>That</mark> lay in the house <mark>that</mark> Jack built.
